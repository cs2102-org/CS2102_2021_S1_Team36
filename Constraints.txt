## Constraints
- Pet Owner or CareTaker is a User . (ISA Relationship)
The ISA relationship has covering and overlap constraints.
Covering constraint as there can only be 2 types of users.
Overlap constraint as the user can use the same account as a Pet Owner and CareTaker.

- Pet has a key+participation constraint with Owns .
A pet must be owned by some pet owner, else, it wonâ€™t be added to the database.
We are also assuming there is no co-own pet feature in our implementation so we added the key constraint.

- Pet has a key+participation constraint with Categorise .
The pet must be categorised as one of the types of pet when added to the database,
and each pet is in exactly one category.
This is such that we can match the base price of the caretaker with the pet when the pet owner is bidding.

- The Bid entity has a key+total participation constraint with the BidsFor relation.
A pet owner can submit the same bid (same CareTaker , and same Pet ) multiple times. A
PetOwner must make payment for a specific bid. Hence, we would like each bid to be
uniquely identified by a bid id. To attach a unique big id to every entry in the BidsFor
relation, we make bid id the primary key for Bid and use the key+total participation
relationship with BidsFor.

- Transactions has a key+participation constraint with PaymentFor .
The transaction must be a one time payment for the successful bid. We are assuming
that the payment cannot be done partially and the full amount has to be paid upfront.

- Transactions has a key+participation constraint with CaringFor.
An entry in CaringFor must be identified by the pet, caretaker and the transaction.
This is such that there can be multiple times the caretaker can take care of the same pet
on different transactions.
If a pet was taken care of by a caretaker, there must be a corresponding transaction
used to identify the entry in CaringFor .

- Review and ReviewFor is a weak entity set.
Additionally, Review has an identity dependency.
A review can only exist with a corresponding transaction. As we are not adding a review
ID, we want the reviews to be identified by the transaction.

- A Review for a Transaction can only be created by the PetOwner involved in that
transaction. (Cannot be captured by ER diagram)

- The rating attribute of a CareTaker is determined by the average rating he/she received
from all the Reviews written about him. (Cannot be captured by ER diagram)

## Justification for using serial types
Serial types will be used to create various identification numbers for entities as it will be
self-incrementing and has to be used to uniquely identify the entities. These entities include:
PCS Administrator, User, Pet, Bid and Transaction.

- PCS Administrator
  - Admin ID
- User
  - User ID
- Pet
  - Pet ID
- Bid
  - Bid ID
- Transaction
  - Transaction ID
